# Gesture-Based Input System

This project implements a gesture-controlled interface that allows users to control applications such as media players using **hand gestures** captured via webcam.  
It leverages **OpenCV** for image processing, **Mediapipe** for hand tracking, and **PyAutoGUI** for simulating keyboard operations.  
A simple **Tkinter GUI** is provided to launch gesture detection.

---

## Features
- Detects hand gestures in real-time via webcam.
- Supports basic media player controls:
  - Forward
  - Backward
  - Volume Up / Down
- Simple GUI built with Tkinter for usability.
- Works with VLC Media Player and other compatible applications.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, Mediapipe, PyAutoGUI, Tkinter
